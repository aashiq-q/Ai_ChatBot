# 🗨️ Streamlit Chatbot using LangChain and Groq API

This project is a simple conversational AI **Chatbot** built with **Streamlit**, powered by **LangChain** and **Groq's Llama 3.1 model**. It supports ongoing conversation memory, so you can chat with it naturally, and all messages are displayed interactively on the web interface.

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashiq-q/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
```
# For Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Configure your .env file
Create a .env file in your project root and add your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```
Important:
Add .env to your .gitignore to keep your API key secret.


### 5️⃣ Run the Streamlit app
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## 💡 How it works

- When you open the app, you can type any question into the input box.
- The conversation uses ConversationChain from LangChain to keep track of what you said previously.
- All messages are stored in st.session_state and displayed nicely in order.

### 🚫 .gitignore example
Make sure your .gitignore includes:
```
.env
.venv/
__pycache__/
```
